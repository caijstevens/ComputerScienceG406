# Privacy Attributes 

**Quasi-identifiers**: attributes that can be linked with external info to re-identify respondents to whom info refers

**Confidential** attributes: represent sensitive info

**Non-confidential** attributes: not considered sensitive by respondents and whose release is harmless 

# k-Anonymity 

Every combination of values of QIs can be indistinctly matched to **at least k respondents**
- if you can re-identify each individual, $k=1$

# Anonymisation Techniques 

**Attribute suppression**: remove QIs from database to avoid re-identification of individual 

**Attribute generalisation**: change value of QI to make it more general value
