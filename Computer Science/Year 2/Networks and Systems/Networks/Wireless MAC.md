# Elements of a Wireless Network 

Wireless hosts:
- wireless end devices: laptops, phones etc 
- run applications 
- stationary or mobile 

Base station:
- normally connected to wired networks 
- relay: sends packets between wired networks and wireless hosts 

Wireless links:
- connect mobiles to base stations 
- backbone links 
- multiple access protocol coordinates link access 
- various data rates and transmission distances

# Wireless Network Modes 

Infrastructure mode:
- base stations connect wireless hosts to wired networks 
- handoff: mobile hosts change base stations providing connections to wired networks 

Ad-hoc mode: 
- no base stations 
- nodes can only transmit to other nodes within link coverage 
- nodes organise themselves into network, route among themselves

# Wireless Link Characteristics 

Decreasing signal strength:
- radio signal attenuates as propagates through matter 
- interference from other sources 

Multipath propagation: 
- radio signal reflects on objects ground, arriving at dest at slightly different times 

# Signals 

>[!info] Signal 
>A signal is a time-varying quantity that conveys info
>$y(t)=A\times\sin(2\times j\times f\times t+p)$
>where $A$ is amplitude, $f$ is frequency, $s=2jf$ is angular frequency, $p$ is phase (position at $t=0$)

In wired connections, high and low voltages give distinguishable waveform

- can still discern high voltage from low despite noise 
- noise must be removed to translate to binary signal 

In wireless, radio waves are a form of EM radiation (freq $30Hz\leq f\leq 300GHz$)
- generated by oscillating electric fields 
- signal creates tiny voltage in receiver that can be measured 

# Exposed Terminals 

>[!info] Exposed Terminals 
>Exposed terminals are senders who can sense each other but still transmit safely. Desirable concurrency, improves performance $B\leftrightarrow A$ and $C\leftrightarrow D$ are exposed terminals

# 802.11: Multiple Access 

Collisions happen if 2 or more nodes transmitting at same time 
- 802.11 uses CSMA to sense before transmitting 
- no collision detection due to weak received signals 

# CSMA/CA 

Sender:
- if sense channel idle, transmit entire frame 
- if busy, start random backoff timer, counts down even if channel idle, sense again when expires 
- if no ACK received or still busy, increase random backoff interval 

# Hidden Terminal Problem 

>[!info] Hidden Terminals 
>Senders that cannot sense each other but still collide at intended receiver

# CSMA/CA with RTS/CTS

Allow sender to reserve channel rather than random access of data frames: avoid collisions of long frames 
- sender transmits small request-to-send (RTS) packets to BS/AP using CSMA (may still collide but are short)
- BS broadcasts clear-to-send (CTS) in response to RTS
- CTS heard by all nodes, sender transmits data frame and other stations wait

# Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs)

>[!info] SSID
>Service Set Identifier: logical name identifies particular wireless network 
- a base station/access point broadcasts frames periodically, can include SSID 
- client device scans all available freqs to find SSIDs to join 
- client selects SSID to join wireless network 

>[!info] BSS
>Basic Service Set (aka cell) in infrastructure mode contains:
>-- base station/access point with one or more client devices 
- client devices communicate through BS/AP 
- clients connected to BSS are **associated**
- association is dynamic, client can move in/out of coverage or be switched off

802.11 Association:
- 2.4GHz ~ 2.485GHz spectrum divided into 11 freq channels 
- AP admin chooses freq for AP 
- interference possible: channel can be same as that chosen by neighbouring AP
- host must associate with AP, scan channels, listen for frames containing AP's SSID and MAC address (BSSID)
