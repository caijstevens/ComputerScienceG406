### Positional Number Systems

Base or radix of number system is number of symbols
- e.g. 10 for decimal, 2 for binary
- the subscript after a number gives the base

### Binary

Each digit in a binary number system is a **bit**
- can only have two possible values 0 or 1

Groups of bits known as:
- Nibble (4)
- Byte (8)
- Half word (16)
- Word (32)
- Double word (64)

Base to decimal = $\Sigma$ (value $\times$ base^position)
